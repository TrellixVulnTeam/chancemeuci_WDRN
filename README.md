This is a Django web application that uses data from UC Irvine to calculate an applicant's chance of admission into 
UC Irvine based on their personal information. It provides a table of their statistics and the average acceptance rate
based on each individual statistic.

This is my first personal project and it took me a little over the course of 30 total hours. I was using this project as a 
way to learn Django, Bootstrap, and in the end when it was too late, version control. My commits are extremely messy and 
I admit I did not use them to their full advantage. I had trouble deploying this project to Heroku (took me ten hours!) 
and that is why my commits are messy and full of gibberish. 

With time, I will learn and get better about how to correctly use version control and documentation for my projects.
